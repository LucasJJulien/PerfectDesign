<h1 align="center"> PerfectDesign </h1>
<p align="center"> The simple and uniform CSS library. </p>

> [!CAUTION]  
> Still in Alpha. ReadME, components, responsive design, and flexbox attributes all underdeveloped. 

## What is PerfectDesign?
PerfectDesign is a simple flexbox based CSS library delivering all core components with no added bloat. It uses a naming convention based on uniformity; d-f is display: flex, fs-10px is fontsize: 10px. The library is meant to be easily modified and function as a framework for web projects.

## Roadmap
- Add support for other devices, including but not limited to: mobile phones and tablets
- Add components (prebuilt mobules such as containers and buttons)
- Add missing glexbox attributes
- Develop ReadME and add examples
