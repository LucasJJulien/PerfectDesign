## What is PerfectDesign?
PerfectDesign is a simple CSS library delivering all core components and nothing more - all in pure, direct css. It uses a naming convention based on uniformity and forthrightness, following a simple syntax: ```{property}-{value}{unit}```. The first letter of each section is extracted: ```d-f``` is ```display: flex```, ```fs-10px``` is ```fontsize: 10px```.
